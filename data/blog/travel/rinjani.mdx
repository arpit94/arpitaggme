# Mt. Rinjani (or Gunong Rinjani in Sasak)

I don't know what to say about this one. It was one of a lifetime kind of experience.

Not sure on where to start. But will definitely try to make you live through the moments I got a chance to experience in real.

(some wikipedia content coming in)
Mount Rinjani is an active volcano in Indonesia on the island of Lombok.

Yes, an active volcano! for real!

It rises to 3,726 metres (12,224 ft), making it the second highest volcano in Indonesia.

Adjacent to the volcano is a 6-by-8.5-km caldera, which is filled partially by the crater lake known as Segara Anak or Anak Laut (Child of the Sea), due to the color of its water, as blue as the sea (laut).
This lake is approximately 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level and estimated to be about 200 metres (660 ft) deep.

So, a crater, a lake, and an active volcano, all very close to the sea. Could we ask for anything else, hell no!
