## Story
It was a friday evening and I was bored of two things - delhi's extreme summers and the work because it had been a long week.
Ranonly started a huddle with the team and started chitchatting. Randonly, Himanshu said, lets go for a trek and we actually ended up saying yet for it.

It was four of us -> Aditi, Shania, Himanshu and Me
We went ahead with booking for the trek via karnataka govt's tourism website and thats all. A quick decision and the plan was on.

Funnily, the trek was ~70kms away from bangalore, and even after trying hard to find a friend with a car, there was no success.
After wasting a few hours on zoomcar, and delaying on until thrusday, we went ahead with a booking.

Himanshu and me planned to pick up the car around 3 am and then pick others and reach the destination by 6 am.
The pickup plan went smoothly. We were able to pick up by the car by 3:30am and while just adjusting to a car and himanshu talking to Shania over a phone call, we jumped the car through a speed breaker and ended up with a huge laughter together.
Post that I understood that there is no need to rush and lets just enjoy the drive. Post picking up Aditi and Shania, maps suggested us a road which was no-go for Shania.
Since it was very early and there were no chances of traffic or blockages, we ended up ignoring Shania's advice and continued on the same.
But damn, you know what we spotted, a dead dog lying down in a very odd way. He was in an upside down position with all his four legs straight up. It definitely didn't feel like a natural death.
Ignoring the dog and laughing on starting with such a bad omen, we continued the journey.
It was still dark out there and there was mist constantly coming on the windshield. But the weather was so pleasant. The highway was two way one with no divider. So ended up not driving above 80 and just enjoying it. Switched no/off the defogger a multiple number of times as needded.
We reached the destination around 5:20 AM, just next to the railway trek. People are usually allowed to start after 6:00 AM and instead of waiting for another 30+ mins, we tried our luck to have a head start.

Our bookings were checked by a representative there and we were allowed to start ~30 mins earlier.

It was still dark and we could hardly see far away.
The trek was rocky. One had to climb high rocks again and again, but due to my long feet, I was at advantage.
But, we had Aditi who was at a disadvantage equivalently. It was her first trek (after a failed attempt to go for Skandgiri). So she was really excited.
But the excitement didn't last long and the hill tested her cardiac health at its best. For beginners, it can be a slighlty tough one, especially for people like us, who spend 10s of hours of a day sitting on a chair next to our laptop.
I feel software developer is a job which is kinda highly bad for your legs/knees/cardiac health

I myself had been prepping for another trek in Bali, so it was not that bad for me, but still, I have been in similar situations as Aditi, not once but many times (Triud, Skandgiri, Kelingking Beach ...)
This time I had been running regularly, so my heart rates were not shooting up that much and were giving me a smooth experience.
But if I was rushing up the hill, I was indeed running out of breath and realized that my trainings are not over yet and I have a long way to go.

Thankful to Aditi and Shania that walking along with them gave me enough breaks that I didn't have to myself ask for it and hide my own lack of endurance.
There were some stretches where there was a big rock, a slippery one and one had to just bend down and climb it. I remember those because on one of them, we had our Aditi being stuck, not able to climb up or go back down.
And following the basic human nature, instead of directly helping her, Himanshu and I chose to laugh on her. Eventually we did help her though.


After an hour and a half of climbing up, we were able to make it to the summit around 7 am.
And I can not explain the winds fully here, so relaxing that one can spend there entire days there doing nothing

It was also not a lot crowded. So, we didn't have to struggle a lot to find a spot and just relax down.
Prior to starting the journey, I had a visit to the Shell petrol pump in Koramangala, which is known for its night cafe. Even at 2:30 AM, the place was so crowded and felt like I am standing outside some college where the day just ended.
I got some chips and chocolates for us. Felt that climbing up the hill, we have kind of earned the right to eat junk food :P


We were accompanied by a few dogs too. There was a small abandoned temple, a broken fort. So all we had was the view downhill and those strong winds.
After spending an hour or so and being scared of the sun to come up and get tanned, we started our journey back to the car

Coming back downhill was a longer one.
For me personally, I never had trouble coming back from the hills/mountains (again be it skandgiri / Triund). I was always able to descent quickly
Even this one was kind of the same.

But while going back we had questions like, did we really climb up these big rocks? It was tough to get down. One had to sit down, take side support and what not again and again.
It was really tough for Aditi too! The rocks were slippery. She actually slipped on one and ended up scratching up her hands.

Luckily, she herself had brought up a pack of bandages (she kind of foresee it!)
After removing a some dust from her hand and washing with water and putting on those band-aids, we were back on track.
She was a bit scared this time though after the fall (kind of a mini trauma)

While descending, we also saw a train going towards the station and it was a lovely view. Not as lovely as seeing Hogwarts Express leaving the 9-3/4 station but lets just settle down to 50% of it.
It was a lovely sight to see the small train passing by.

We were back to the car around 9:30. The sun was almost coming out of the clouds now and we were so happy that we didn't have to beat the heat at all and what a relaxing one this was!

Coming back was a simple one. We had breakfast at one of Udupi styled restaurants.
Returning the car was a challenge as there was so much traffic in the city, and Himanshu and I actually ended up getting stuck for an hour just a few hundred meters from the car drop off point.

It was still a smooth ride. Himanshu dropped me back at my place.

After taking a cold shower, and having a meal from Mumbai Tiffins, I hit the bed and had a really good sleep.
Post waking up around 8 pm (perfect for the world cup final), I didn't even know what day it was and for how long I was sleeping!


Thats all, thanks for reading it!, this is some of my early attempts to writing, so please bear with me equivalently and I promise that with time, I'll experiment and learn more and write in a fashion which is worth your time!
Thanks again!
Sayonara!
