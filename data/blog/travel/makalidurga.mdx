# Story

## Plan
It was a normal friday evening and I was bored of two things - delhi's extreme summers (the month of June was really hot ☀️) and the work because it had been a really long week.
I was travelling to bangalore the coming Monday, so anyways, was going to get a break from the former.
For the latter, I started a random huddle with the team and started chit-chatting.
We were discussing how is everyone doing and what are our plans for the coming weekend.
Out of nowhere, Himanshu said -  lets go for a trek next weekend and we ended up saying yes for it instantly.

After some people saying no, some saying maybe, it was the four of us -> Aditi, Shania, Himanshu and Me who agreed to it.
We went ahead with the booking for the trek via karnataka govt's tourism website and thats all. A quick discussion and the plan was on.
Even after multiple attempts of onboarding someone to the plan with a car, we failed miserably and decided to take a zoomcar.
After wasting a few hours on zoomcar, spanning over multiple days, and delaying till thrusday night, we finally booked a car - a Maruti Swift - parked somewhere near Bommanahalli

We planned to start at 2:30 AM, get the car by 3 and then reach the destination worst case by 6 AM. Everyone had to sleep in very early that day.

The pickup plan went smoothly. Himanshu picked me up from my place, we went to the car pickup place together and after collecting the keys from the sleeping guards, the car pick up was done by 3:30am.

Post that, we headed towards Aditi's place and then Shania's. We had a few speed bumps in between which ended up giving me and Himanshu a good set of laughters.

We had put on google maps to point us towards Makalidurga, and it showed us a way via a narrow road which Shania warned us to not take. She said the road is not so safe and one should avoid it.
Completely ignoring Shania's advice, we followed google maps and damn, we saw something really odd, a dead dog lying upside-down in a very odd way. He had all of his four legs straight up. It didn't feel like a natural death for sure. One of those dark moments at the beginning itself.
Ignoring the dog and laughing on starting with such a bad omen, we continued the journey.

It was still dark out there and I was struggling with fog on the windshield. Had to switch on/off the defogger like 50 times.
The weather outside was so pleasant, breezy, so we didn't want to switch on the air conditioner inside and had our windows rolled down.
A big portion of the highway was single lane one with no dividers. So ended up not driving above 80 and just enjoyed it.
We reached the base point of the trek around 5:20 AM. There was a big parking next to the railway track, and had been put up by a nearby resort facility.
We parked the car there but still were nearly 30 mins early. People are usually not allowed to start before 6:00 AM

We went ahead and tried our luck to start early. After crossing the railway tracks and getting our bookings verified by a tourism rep, we were allowed to enter and start for the trek.

Here is a snap of how dark it was, when we started for the trek

The trek was a rocky one. One had to climb barren rocks again and again.

It was Aditi's first trek (after a failed attempt to Skandgiri where she was denied entry without a ticket).
She was really excited about it but the excitement didn't last very long.
It was replaced by some breathlessness and confusions around where to put the leg to climb the next rock.
The hill started testing everyone's cardiac health.

I have had been in similar states and maybe even worse. The most unhealthy guy far away from any kind of sports/exercising.
Gyming was my only thing, but it was always about muscles and not getting fitter.
It reminded me of my visits to Triud and Skandgiri both.
Among my friends, I was the slowest one and used to stop after every few meters to catch my breath. It was really tough for me.

This time it was a bit different though.
I have been planning to go for a trek near Mt. Rinjani and had been exercising to prepare for it since its a difficult one.
Have been going on those long running sessions multiple times a week now.
As a result, my heart rates were normal this time and I was able to climb without putting in a lot of effort.
In middle, I tried rushing up the hill, but indeed, was running out of breath and realized that my trainings are not over yet and have to go a long way.

There were some stretches where there was a really big rock, a slippery one and one had to just bend down and climb it. I remember those because on one of them, we had our Aditi being stuck, not able to climb up or go back down.
And following the basic human nature, Himanshu and I shared a good laughter. Eventually we did help her though.


After an hour and a half of climbing up, we were finally able to make it to the top. It was around 7 am now.

The place was not so crowded (unlike other treks near bangalore).
We didn't have to struggle a lot to find a spot and just sit and relax.

Prior to starting the journey, I had a visit to the Shell petrol pump in Koramangala, which is known for its night cafe.
Even at 2:30 AM, the place was full of people and it felt like I am standing outside some college where everyone is just leaving for their home.
I got some chips and chocolates for us. Felt that climbing up the hill, we have kind of earned the right to eat junk food :P

Other than the people, we were also accompanied by two stray dogs who were looking for food. I just tried to think around how they would have climbed those rough rocks.

The view from the top looked like this.

The weather was just apt. Strong winds brushing through our skin.
After spending an hour or so and being scared of the sun coming up and us getting tanned, we started our journey back to the car

Going back downhill ended up more time consuming for us than going up.
For me personally, I have never had trouble coming back from the hills/mountains (again be it skandgiri / Triund).
I was always able to descent quickly. I don't know, maybe there is no cardiac strength needed, thats why.
Even this one was kind of the same.
@hile going back we had questions like, did we really climb up these big rocks?
It was tough to get down. One had to sit down, take side support and what not again and again.
It was really tough for Aditi too! The rocks were slippery. She actually slipped on one and ended up wounding her hands.

Luckily, she herself had brought up a pack of band-aids (she kind of foresee it!)
She was a bit scared post that and was worried that she'll slip again.

While descending, we also saw a train going towards the station and it was a lovely view. Not as lovely as seeing Hogwarts Express leaving the 9-3/4 station but lets just settle down to 50% of it.
It was a lovely sight to see the small train passing by.

We were back to the car around 9:30. The sun was almost coming out of the clouds now and we were so happy that we didn't have to face the heat at all and what a relaxing one this was!

The track looked like this now

Coming back was a simple one. We had breakfast at one of the Udupi styled restaurants.
Returning the car was a challenge as there was so much traffic in the city by now.
Himanshu and I ended up wasting an hour in traffic a just few hundred meters away from the car drop off point.

It was still a smooth ride.

After taking a cold shower, and having a meal from Mumbai Tiffins, I just hit the bed and had a really good sleep.

Post waking up around 8 pm (perfect for the world cup final), I didn't even know what day it was and for how long I was sleeping!


Thats all, thanks for reading it!, this is some of my early attempts to writing, so please bear with me and I promise that I'll improve with time.
Thanks again for your time!
Sayonara!
